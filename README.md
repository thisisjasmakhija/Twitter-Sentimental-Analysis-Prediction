# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis-Prediction
Supervised Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of users based on their tweets. It utilizes supervised machine learning techniques to classify tweets based on their sentiment. The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed using Python libraries, and various machine learning models were implemented and compared.


## Features
- Sentiment classification of tweets as **positive** or **negative**.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using **Pandas** and other Python libraries.
- Implementation of multiple **supervised machine learning models**.
- Performance comparison of models to determine the most effective approach.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (for data cleaning and manipulation)
- **Scikit-Learn** (for machine learning models)
- **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Random Forest**

## Dataset
The dataset consists of tweets labeled with their corresponding sentiment (positive or negative). It was cleaned to remove noise, stopwords, and irrelevant characters to improve the model's accuracy.

## Machine Learning Models Implemented
1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
2. **Naive Bayes**
3. **Random Forest**

## Steps in the Project
1. **Data Cleaning:** Removed unnecessary characters, stopwords, and special symbols.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Converted text data into numerical form using techniques like TF-IDF.
3. **Model Training:** Applied multiple machine learning models.
4. **Performance Evaluation:** Compared models based on accuracy and other metrics.

## Results
The project involved comparing the accuracy and efficiency of different models, providing insights into which algorithm performs best for sentiment classification on Twitter data.

## Future Improvements
- Implementing **deep learning models** such as LSTMs for better accuracy.
- Expanding the dataset for more generalized sentiment analysis.
- Enhancing preprocessing with more NLP techniques.
